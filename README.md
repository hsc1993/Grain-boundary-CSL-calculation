## Usage

### Dislocation extraction

## Example

A demonstration of CSL calculation from rotating and shifting one plane of atoms. the black grid is rotated with respect to the gray grid, and then a shift vector(the blue line) is applied to the black graid to generate the purple lattice. Notice that the purple lattice will have coincident site with the original grey grid, which are marked with blue squares, and those are the CSLs of the Grain boundary under certain rotaion and shifting.

A plane of atoms for one grain, with indices labeled. Red atoms are on the principle axis, blue atoms are not. The orange line and blue line are unit vectors e1 and e2 of the current plane.
